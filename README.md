 # Exam Engine. Crossover Online Testing Platform by Raydelto Hernandez
 
This is a simple exam engine written in Java EE, using Spring  , Hibernate and Maven.  Was done as a techtrial for www.crossover.com.
 
I have created this Online Testing Platform trial test using Java 7, Spring, Hibernate, Maven, Tomcat , MySQL and Eclipse Mars.

I made the code as simple as possible, it's using the Spring's MVC capabilities, and Hibernate object persistence facilities in conjunction with JPA.

In this deliverable I have included the SQL insertion scripts that will allow you to test this code. The username is 'arca' and the password is 'adios'. We are using MD5
encription for the password that's why the password field in the database has 32 characters, since MD5 generates 32 bytes hashes.

If you have any queries about my code, feel free to contact me at raydelto@gmail.com , and please visit my github profile for more Java and C++ code (https://github.com/raydelto).

I have uploaded the wink video showing the functionalities to youtube as unlisted, so it can be seen only accesing directly through this link https://youtu.be/-qlLgNTyanc .
